# Dungeon Crawl

Your task, brave adventurer, is to enter the dungeon and return with the
treasure.  Will you brave the perils of the unknown?
 

###NOTES
This is a test "module" of sorts for a text-based dungeon crawler (think
old adventure games, like Zork -- just without the grues). 

I intend to make this into a larger game (although still "small" by most
standards), mainly dependent on time or other factors.
